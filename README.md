# Brawl Stars Search 💥
A Brawler Search website using the Brawl API, designed to help users explore brawlers by class and find the best match for their play style.

## Context 📚
This project was created for my System Design class to explore using open-source APIs. I used the Brawl API to build a Brawler Search website, organizing brawlers by class with detailed information and descriptions. It helped me practice API integration, front-end coding, and visual design.

## Use Case 📋
The site helps new Brawl Stars players decide which brawler to unlock based on their play style.
Since players can only unlock one brawler at a time, the site serves as a tool to:

- Compare brawlers.
- Learn about their abilities.
- Understand how each brawler fits into different play styles.
